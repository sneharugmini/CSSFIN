                        Welcome to my digital oasis! I'm a passionate wildlife enthusiast, dedicated to capturing the
                        raw beauty of our natural world through my eyes and the lines of my code. As a computer
                        programming student and nature lover, I've embarked on a journey to merge the realms of
                        technology and the great outdoors. Through this portfolio, I invite you to explore the stunning
                        tapestry of life that I'd like to weave together-from the intricate patterns of code that power
                        my projects to the breathtaking moments frozen in time by my memories outdoors. Join me on this
                        visual and technological expedition as we celebrate the majesty of wildlife and the artistry of
                        programming.

                    these passions have existed separately in my projects, I'm eager to unite them. I envision crafting
                    digital experiences that capture the natural world's beauty, infusing my creations with the serenity
                    and vitality of the outdoors. </p>

                    <h3>HARLEY QUINN</h3>
                    <p>
                        My first venture into web design centered around creating a website dedicated to Harley Quinn,
                        one of my favorite characters. Through this project, I delved into the technical intricacies of
                        HTML and CSS. I meticulously structured and formatted the site, refining my skills in both
                        coding and design. This experience not only deepened my appreciation for the intersection of
                        technology and creativity but also ignited a passion for web development. </p>

                    <h3>TOMB DEFENDER</h3>
                    <p>
                        My coding journey took an exciting turn when I crafted an interactive game titled "The Tomb
                        Defender" using C#. A playful twist on the renowned "Tomb Raider," this game flipped the
                        narrative by making Lara Croft the antagonist. In this immersive experience, players became
                        natives defending their sacred land against her incursions. Through coding, I transformed an
                        idea into reality, weaving storytelling and strategy to create an engaging gameplay. </p>

                    <h3>FIRE ALARM SYSTEM</h3>
                    <p>Through the fusion of technology and innovation, I engineered a functional fire alarm system
                        using Arduino that transcends traditional boundaries. Designed with inclusivity in mind, this
                        system boasts an LCD screen featuring warning symbols, rendering it accessible to the deaf
                        community. As a testament to my commitment to safety and usability, I ensured that the alarm's
                        sound adhered to regulations while remaining audibly robust.</p>
